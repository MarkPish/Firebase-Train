# Firebase-Train-Scheduler
Firebase Assignment - Train Scheduler (Basic)
A train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. This app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. 
This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
You will have the ability to add additional trains which will be dynamically updated and added to the train list.


Currently, outside of the daily date and updating clock I am not returning the data from moment as expected....back to the drawing board!
